    description: "Smaller than Blackbirds, Starlings have a short tail, pointed head and triangular wings. In their breeding plumage, they look black at a distance. When seen closer, they are very glossy with a sheen of purples and greens. Their feathers are also flecked with white and this is especially noticeable in their winter plumage, which is more brown with many bright white spots. Starling flight is fast and direct and they walk and run confidently on the ground. Noisy and social, Starlings spend a lot of the year in flocks. Starlings are fantastic mimics and can make a huge variety of tweets, cheeps, clicks and burrs.",

    description: "Male Blackbirds are black with a bright orange-yellow beak and yellow eye-ring. Females are brown often with spots and streaks on their breasts and brown beak. The Blackbird is one of the most common UK birds and one of the most striking. Its mellow song is also a favourite.",

    description: "The Goldfinch is a highly coloured finch with a bright red face and yellow wing patch. Sociable, often breeding in loose colonies, they have a delightful liquid twittering song and call. Their long fine beaks allow them to extract otherwise inaccessible seeds from thistles and teasels.",

    description: "Not as colourful as some of its relatives, the Coal Tit has a distinctive grey back, black cap, and white patch at the back of its neck. It has a smaller, skinnier bill than Blue or Great Tits which helps it feed in conifers. A regular visitor to most feeders, they will take and store food for eating later. In winter they join with other tits to form flocks which roam through woodland and gardens in search of food.",

    description: "The Long-tailed Tit is easily recognisable with its distinctive blush, black and white colouring. It also has a tail which is bigger than its body, and a bouncing flight. Sociable and noisy residents, Long-tailed Tits are most usually noticed in small, excitable flocks of about 20 birds. Like most tits, they rove the woods and hedgerows, but are also seen on heaths and commons with suitable bushes.",

    description: "With its noisy chattering, black-and-white plumage and long tail, there is nothing else quite like the Magpie in the UK. When seen close-up, its black plumage reveals a purplish-blue iridescent sheen to the wing feathers and a green gloss to the tail. Magpies seem to be jacks of all trades - scavengers, predators and pest-destroyers, their challenging, almost arrogant attitude has won them few friends.",

Although shy in the countryside it can be tame and approachable in towns and cities. Its cooing call is a familiar sound in woodland as is the loud clatter of its wings when it flies away.",

    description: "The UK's favourite bird. Thanks to its bright red breast, it's familiar throughout the year and especially at Christmas! Males and females look identical, young birds have no red breast and are spotted with golden brown. Robins sing nearly all year round and despite their cute appearance, they are aggressively territorial and are quick to drive away intruders. They will sing at night next to street lights.",
